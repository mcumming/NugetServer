# Implementation Summary

## Objective
Build a Docker container for the NuGet Gallery that:
1. Checks out and builds the latest source from https://github.com/nuget/nugetgallery
2. Creates a container image that runs the NuGetGallery project
3. Uses a multi-stage Dockerfile
4. Includes a CI/CD build pipeline

## Technical Considerations

### Framework Compatibility
The NuGet Gallery is built on **.NET Framework 4.7.2** (ASP.NET MVC), which is a Windows-only framework. The original requirement specified "Linux based base image" and "Run with .NET 9", but this is not technically feasible because:

- .NET Framework applications require Windows operating system
- .NET Framework is separate from .NET Core/.NET (versions 5+)
- The NuGetGallery codebase would require complete rewrite to run on .NET 9

### Solution Approach
This implementation uses:
- **Windows Server Core 2022 LTSC** containers (instead of Linux)
- **.NET Framework 4.8** SDK and runtime (latest compatible version, instead of .NET 9)
- **Multi-stage build** as required
- **IIS** web server (native to Windows)

## Files Created

### 1. Dockerfile
Multi-stage Dockerfile with two stages:
- **Build stage**: Uses `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.8-windowsservercore-ltsc2022`
  - Installs Git
  - Clones NuGetGallery repository
  - Restores NuGet packages
  - Builds the solution with MSBuild
  - Publishes the web application
  
- **Runtime stage**: Uses `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8-windowsservercore-ltsc2022`
  - Copies built application
  - Configures IIS
  - Exposes port 80
  - Includes health check
  - Uses ServiceMonitor for IIS management

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/build-docker.yml)
CI/CD pipeline that:
- Runs on Windows 2022 runners
- Builds the Docker image
- Tests the container with health checks
- Optionally saves and uploads the image as an artifact
- Triggered on push to main, PRs, and manual workflow dispatch

### 3. Helper Scripts

#### build.ps1
PowerShell script for building the Docker image with:
- Tag customization
- Pull option control
- Validation of Windows container mode
- Build time tracking
- User-friendly output

#### run.ps1
PowerShell script for running the container with:
- Container name and port customization
- Existing container detection and management
- Health check monitoring
- Helpful command reference
- Status feedback

### 4. Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)
Orchestration configuration with:
- Service definition
- Port mapping
- Health check configuration
- Restart policy
- Placeholder for environment variables and volumes

### 5. .dockerignore
Excludes unnecessary files:
- Git files
- Documentation
- IDE settings
- Build artifacts
- Test results
- CI/CD configurations

### 6. Updated README.md
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Project overview
- Technical notes about Windows/Framework requirements
- Prerequisites
- Multiple build methods (script, docker, docker-compose)
- Multiple run methods
- Container management
- Configuration requirements
- Health checks
- Troubleshooting guide
- File descriptions

## Usage Examples

### Build the image:
```powershell
.\build.ps1
# or
docker build -t nugetgallery:latest .
# or
docker-compose build
```

### Run the container:
```powershell
.\run.ps1
# or
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nugetgallery nugetgallery:latest
# or
docker-compose up -d
```

### Access the application:
http://localhost:8080

## Build Process Flow

1. Docker pulls Windows Server Core SDK image (~4-5 GB)
2. Git is installed in the container
3. NuGetGallery repository is cloned
4. NuGet packages are restored
5. MSBuild compiles the solution
6. Web application is published
7. Runtime image pulls ASP.NET image (~3-4 GB)
8. Published files are copied to runtime image
9. IIS is configured
10. Container is ready to run

**Estimated build time**: 15-30 minutes (first build)
**Image size**: ~8-10 GB (Windows containers are larger than Linux)

## Testing

The GitHub Actions workflow includes automated testing:
1. Starts the container
2. Monitors health check status
3. Waits up to 2 minutes for healthy status
4. Logs container output if health check fails
5. Cleans up test container

## Limitations and Notes

1. **Requires Windows containers**: Must run on Windows Server or Windows 10/11 with Docker Desktop in Windows container mode
2. **Large image size**: Windows containers are significantly larger than Linux containers
3. **Configuration needed**: The NuGet Gallery requires database and storage configuration to be fully functional
4. **Build time**: Initial build downloads large base images and compiles the entire solution

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add example configuration files
- Include database initialization scripts
- Add volume mounts for persistent data
- Create Azure deployment templates
- Add monitoring and logging configuration
- Include sample environment variable configuration
